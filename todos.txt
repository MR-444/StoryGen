Todos:
- more things which can happen when moving around.
  - random encounters
    - interaction with encounters in both directions.
- implement the jumpable objects as real object in a location.

- create 3 objects,
- randomize their occurrence in a location.


far future
-------------
- think about how you want to represent a large number of objects like livingThings or realwordobjects.
  to build 1000 classes for 1000 animals would be a bad idea?
  (put only the description in a config file? (db?)
  => Initialize with a DB
  => todo: you have to build the relations
  => save the initialized structures and do not forget the relations!



done
----
- Sophisticate the memory (Use H2 or asami (https://github.com/threatgrid/asami) )
  how to integrate h2: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48357523/how-to-use-kotlin-with-h2-and-sqlite-in-intellij
- Say <subject> go to <direction> when visiting a new unknown location give a name to it in dependence to the attributes
  of the location.
- let have locations objects Working on.
- command: look at (location/object)



-Build a object builder
-read the objects from the persistence layer created by the builder.
